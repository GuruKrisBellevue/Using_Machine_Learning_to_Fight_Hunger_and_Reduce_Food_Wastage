# Using_Machine_Learning_to_Fight_Hunger_and_Reduce_Food_Wastage
The Project aims to use machine learning techniques such as regression to study the patterns of surplus food production in the U.S., build a prediction model to estimate food wastage, and explore various ways to reduce it, thus fighting hunger and starvation.
